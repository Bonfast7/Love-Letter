# My Dearest Adin,

In the stillness between moments, my heart always finds its way back to you. You are the gentle rhythm that steadies my breath, the quiet warmth that lingers even when the world feels cold.

Your presence is a melody I never tire of—soft, familiar, and endlessly comforting. The way you listen, the way you care, the way you simply exist beside me—it all feels like home. In your gaze, I find peace; in your laughter, I rediscover joy.

Our story is stitched together by countless memories—some loud with laughter, others tender with silence. Each one is a thread I hold close, woven into the fabric of a love that grows deeper with time.

So here I am, offering these words as a reflection of my heart. You are the verse I return to, the chapter I never want to end. And as the pages turn, I look forward to every line we’ll write together.

Forever Yours,
